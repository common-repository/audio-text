== Description ==
This Amazing Plugin Is Designed To Increase Sales For All Online Store Owner's.
The plugin is called Wp Sales Pitch.
It functions in tandem with your product descriptions, effectively increasing product sales.
Product descriptions are always non verbal, usually cut & paste, & most times generic, which on their own, are definitely not enough to convince customers to press the buy button at a high percentage rate.
Wp Sales Pitch
Will Increase Your Sales!

How:

Wp Sales Pitch gives online store owners the ability to place audio description play buttons directly next to each of their products.

When the perspective customer presses the play button an mp3 audio file will play, verbally expressing the wonderful benefits of your products & relating to your customer the percise personal reasons why they should buy the product.

After all, the perspective customer is already on your website because they are interested in your products, & every successful storeowner hires great salespeople who know how to speak to the customers, convincing them to purchase the product.
Start verbally expressing the selling points of your products & make your customers feel comfortable buying all of your products.

With Wp Sales Pitch
